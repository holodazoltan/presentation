famous software disasters
-----

Faulty software can be buggy, expensive, embarrassing, destructive and deadly.

# Mariner Bugs Out (1962)
* **disaster**: The Mariner 1 rocket with a space probe headed for Venus diverted from its intended flight path shortly after launch. Mission Control destroyed the rocket 293 seconds after liftoff.
* **cause**: A programmer incorrectly transcribed a handwritten formula into computer code, missing a single superscript bar. Without the smoothing function indicated by the bar, the software treated normal variations of velocity as if they were serious, causing faulty corrections that sent the rocket off course.

* **cost**: $18.5 million

# Hartford Coliseum Collapse (1978)
* **disaster**: Just hours after thousands of fans had left the Hartford Coliseum, the steel-latticed roof collapsed under the weight of wet snow.
* **cause**: The programmer of the CAD software used to design the coliseum incorrectly assumed the steel roof supports would only face pure compression.  But when one of the supports unexpectedly buckled from the snow, it set off a chain reaction that brought down the other roof sections like dominoes.

* **cost**: $70 million, plus another $20 million damage to the local economy

# CIA Gives the Soviets Gas (1982)
* **disaster**: Control software went haywire and produced intense pressure in the Trans-Siberian gas pipeline, resulting in the largest man-made non-nuclear explosion in Earth’s history. The explosion was so big it was seen from space.
* **cause**: CIA operatives allegedly planted a bug in a Canadian computer system purchased by the Soviets to control their gas pipelines. The purchase was part of a strategic Soviet plan to steal or covertly obtain sensitive U.S. technology. When the CIA discovered the purchase, they sabotaged the software so that it would pass Soviet inspection but fail in operation. [more](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/ghill4/sample-page/review-2/)
* **cost**: $millions

# World War III… Almost (1983)
* **disaster**: The Soviet early warning system falsely indicated the United States had launched five ballistic missiles. Fortunately the Soviet duty officer had a “funny feeling in my gut” and reasoned if the U.S. was really attacking they would launch more than five missiles, so he reported the apparent attack as a false alarm. 
* **cause**: A bug in the Soviet software failed to filter out false missile detections caused by sunlight reflecting off cloud-tops. [more](https://www.wired.com/2007/09/dayintech-0926-2/)
* **cost**: nearly all of humanity

# Medical Machine Kills (1985)
* **disaster**: Canada’s Therac-25 radiation therapy machine malfunctioned and delivered lethal radiation doses to patients. 
* **cause**: Because of a subtle bug called a race condition, a technician could accidentally configure Therac-25 so the electron beam would fire in high-power mode without the proper patient shielding. [more](https://hackaday.com/2015/10/26/killed-by-a-machine-the-therac-25/)
* **cost**: three people dead, three people critically injured

# AT&T Lines Go Dead (1990)
* **disaster**: A single switch at one of AT&T’s 114 switching centers suffered a minor mechanical problem and shut down the center. When the center came back up, it sent a message to other switching centers, which in turn caused them to shut down and brought down the entire AT&T network for 9 hours.
* **cause**: A single line of buggy code in a complex software upgrade implemented to speed up calling caused a ripple effect that shut down the network.[more](https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/Papers/att_collapse)
* **cost**: 75 million phone calls missed, 200 thousand airline reservations lost

# Patriot Fails Soldiers (1991)
* **disaster**: During the first Gulf War, an American Patriot Missile system in Saudi Arabia failed to intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile. The missile destroyed an American Army barracks.
* **cause**: A software rounding error incorrectly calculated the time, causing the Patriot system to ignore the incoming Scud missile. [more](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold//disasters/patriot.html)
* **cost**: 28 soldiers dead, 100 injured

# Pentium Fails Long Division (1993)
* **disaster**: Intel’s highly-promoted Pentium chip occasionally made mistakes when dividing floating-point numbers within a specific range. For example, dividing 4195835.0/3145727.0 yielded 1.33374 instead of 1.33382, an error of 0.006%.  Although the bug affected few users, it become a public relations nightmare.  With an estimated 5 million defective chips in circulation, Intel offered to replace Pentium chips only for consumers who could prove they needed high accuracy.  Eventually Intel replaced the chips for anyone who complained.
* **cause**: The divider in the Pentium floating point unit had a flawed division table, missing about five of a thousand entries and resulting in these rounding errors. [more](http://www.willamette.edu/~mjaneba/pentprob.html)
* **cost**: $475 million, corporate credibility

# Ariane Rocket Goes Boom (1996)
* **disaster**: Ariane 5, Europe’s newest unmanned rocket, was intentionally destroyed seconds after launch on its maiden flight. Also destroyed was its cargo of four scientific satellites to study how the Earth’s magnetic field interacts with solar winds.
* **cause**: Shutdown occurred when the guidance computer tried to convert the sideways rocket velocity from 64-bits to a 16-bit format. The number was too big, and an overflow error resulted. When the guidance system shut down, control passed to an identical redundant unit, which also failed because it was running the same algorithm.  [more](https://around.com/ariane.html)
* **cost**: $500 million

# Mars Climate Crasher (1998)
* **disaster**: After a 286-day journey from Earth, the Mars Climate Orbiter fired its engines to push into orbit around Mars.  The engines fired, but the spacecraft fell too far into the planet’s atmosphere, likely causing it to crash on Mars.
* **cause**: The software that controlled the Orbiter thrusters used imperial units (pounds of force), rather than metric units (Newtons) as specified by NASA. [more](http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/space/9909/30/mars.metric.02/)
* **cost**: $125 million

# British Passports to Nowhere (1999)
* **disaster**: The U.K. Passport Agency implemented a new Siemens computer system, which failed to issue passports on time for a half million British citizens. The Agency had to pay millions in compensation, staff overtime and umbrellas for people queuing in the rain for passports.
* **cause**: The Passport Agency rolled out its new computer system without adequately testing it or training its staff. At the same time, a law change required all children under 16 traveling abroad to obtain a passport, resulting in a huge spike in passport demand that overwhelmed the buggy new computer system.

* **cost**: £12.6 million, mass inconvenience

# Y2K (1999)
* **disaster**: One man’s disaster is another man’s fortune, as demonstrated by the infamous Y2K bug. Businesses spent billions on programmers to fix a glitch in legacy software. While no significant computer failures occurred, preparation for the Y2K bug had a significant cost and time impact on all industries that use computer technology.
* **cause**: To save computer storage space, legacy software often stored the year for dates as two digit numbers, such as “99” for 1999.  The software also interpreted “00” to mean 1900 rather than 2000, so when the year 2000 came along, bugs would result.

* **cost**: $500 billion
